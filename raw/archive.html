║
║        The one born from an apple tree, her passion to discover what lies beyond the mountains that surround her land
║        is admirable.
║        Though the beggining of her journey is only a subsconscious wake up call to discover the secrets behind her existence.
║
║        Ceresians might refer to her as "The Tower" one of the major arcanas from the tarot.

║
║        Loyal companion of Apfel, he hasn't gotten his wake up call yet, his origins are unknown even to me... And I can see everything.
║        He might not show like it but the curiosity consumes him, "Where are my memories?". 
║        But in the end, taking care of Apfel is his main responsabilty right now.
║
║        Ceresians might refer to him as "Wheel of Fortune" one of the major arcanas from the tarot.

║        at the young age of thirteen.
║        Emilio Agrippa took the role of her lacking parental figure because she seemed interested in various fields on where he was also
║        interested in, he also felt a strong connection to Blume because he felt like she could be the daughter he could never have.
║

║     Emilio Agrippa:
║
║        After losing her wife and unborn daughter in a car accident he fell into depression, isolating himself from any kind of external contact.
║        He's a former climate scientist that started researching alchemy out of desperation to seek a greater being that could grant him
║        anything he'd wish.
║        And of course, he would not stop until finding a way to meet his deceased wife once again, that's when he made a deal with
║        Mantana Terra Sinesperia.
║        He would forget about this deal he made once he got to know Blume, he accepted fate and decided that he would have to move on.
║        But the deal was never terminated... And you know how "The Devil" likes to handle things.
║
║        Ceresians might refer to him as "The Hermit" one of the major arcanas from the tarot.

║
║        I feel a very similar aura coming from Ili.

║        He's a good friend of Parmesan, they seem to live togheter. Ili is very calm, unlike Parmesan, that brings some balance to the duo.
